This folder contains projects and exercises completed as part of the **Fundamental Math for Data Science** course offered by [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/enrolled/paths/fundamental-math-for-data-science).

## Course Overview
The **Fundamental Math for Data Science** course covers essential mathematical concepts that are foundational for data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling. The course is designed to strengthen mathematical thinking and problem-solving skills with a focus on applications in data science.

### Topics Covered:
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Understanding measures of central tendency, dispersion, and data distribution.
- **Probability**: Basics of probability theory, conditional probability, and Bayes' Theorem.
- **Distributions**: Introduction to normal distribution, binomial distribution, and more.
- **Linear Algebra**: Vectors, matrices, and matrix operations relevant to data manipulation.
- **Calculus**: Differentiation and integration with applications in data science models.

## Folder Structure
Each subfolder contains a project or exercise related to the course topics. The structure is organized as follows:

```
.
├── Project_Name/
│   ├── project_description.txt
│   ├── analysis.ipynb
│   ├── data.csv
│   ├── results.png
```

- **project_description.txt**: A brief overview of the project and its objectives.
- **analysis.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis and code implementation.
- **data.csv**: Any dataset used for the project.
- **results.png**: Visualizations or results from the analysis.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python and Jupyter installed to run the notebooks. Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

## Running Projects
