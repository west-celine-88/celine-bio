Rosalind Coding Challenges

This folder contains my solutions to bioinformatics coding challenges from Rosalind.info.

About Rosalind

Rosalind is an educational platform that offers hands-on programming problems in bioinformatics. Since 2025, I have been practicing my bioinformatics skills by solving coding challenges on Rosalind. 
My code to solve these challenges are saved in this folder. 

Folder Structure

Each subfolder or file corresponds to a specific problem from Rosalind. Typically, the structure follows this format:

.
├── Problem_Name/
│   ├── problem_description.txt
│   ├── solution.py
│   ├── sample_input.txt
│   ├── sample_output.txt

problem_description.txt: A brief summary or copy of the problem statement from Rosalind.

solution.py: The Python solution to the problem.

sample_input.txt: Example input provided by Rosalind.

sample_output.txt: Expected output for the given input.

Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed to run the solutions. You can check by running:

python --version

Running a Solution

To execute a Python solution, navigate to the problem folder and run:

python solution.py

Make sure any required input files are in the same directory.
